\       Name: DrawLandscapeAndBuffers (Part 1 of 4)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Landscape
\    Summary: Draw the landscape and the contents of the graphics buffers, from
\             the back of the screen to the front
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Both the landscape and objects are drawn one tile row at a time, working from
\ the back to the front. In each iteration, we process a horizontal row of tile
\ corners, working from left to right and back to front. For each corner we draw
\ a landscape tile where possible (i.e. when we have already processed the other
\ three corners in that tile, so we don't start drawing until we reach the
\ second corner on the second row).
\
\ Objects are drawn after the tiles on which they sit. This is achieved by
\ staggering the drawing of objects so they are drawn two rows later than the
\ landscape, so we draw an object two iterations after we have finished drawing
\ all four of its surrounding tiles. This ensures that the landscape always
\ appears behind the objects that sit on it.
\
\ More specifically, we do the following:
\
\   * Part 1: Start by setting up all the variables
\
\   * We now step through each row of tile corners, working through the tile
\     corners from left to right, one row at a time, keeping track of the row
\     number in tileCornerRow = 0 to 10
\
\     For each row of tile corners, we do the following:
\
\     * Part 2: Work along the current row of tile corners, from left to right,
\               one corner coordinate at a time, and draw each tile as a
\               quadrilateral once we have four valid corner coordinates from
\               the previous row and previous column
\
\     * Part 3: If tileCornerRow >= 2, also draw the contents of the graphics
\               buffer with number tileCornerRow - 2
\
\   * Part 4: Finish by drawing the objects in graphics buffer 9 and graphics
\             buffer 10
\
\ So we draw the objects in graphics buffer 0 just after we process tile corner
\ row 2, so that's just after we draw the tiles between corner rows 1 and 2.
\
\ Note that graphics buffer 11 is defined but is not used, as the landscape is
\ only ten tile rows deep.

\       Name: GetLandscapeAltitude
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Landscape
\    Summary: Calculate the altitude of the landscape for a given coordinate
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine calculates the altitude of the landscape at a given coordinate.
\ The altitude is inverse, with lower values indicating higher altitudes. The
\ launchpad is at LAUNCHPAD_ALTITUDE, while the sea is at SEA_LEVEL.
\
\ The altitude at landscape coordinate (x, z) is calculated as follows:
\
\ &05000000 - (   2*sin(x - 2z)  + 2*sin(4x + 3z)  + 2*sin(3z - 5x)
\               + 2*sin(3x + 3z) +   sin(5x + 11z) +   sin(10x + 7z)
\             ) / 256
\
\ Note that the object map is flat, like a paper map, so the x- and z-axes on
\ the map correspond to the x- and z-axes in the three-dimensional space when
\ the map is laid out on the landscape (as the 3D z-axis goes into the screen).
\ When talking about the map, we are talking about (x, z) coordinates that are
\ a bit like longitude and latitude, and this routine returns the y-coordinate
\ of the point on the landscape (as the y-axis goes down the screen and
\ determines the altitude).
\
\ Note that more negative values denote lower altitudes, as the y-axis goes down
\ the screen, working down from zero at the very highest altitude in space. This
\ is the opposite to conventional altitudes in the real world.
\
\ The altitude is capped to a maximum value of SEA_LEVEL, and the altitude on
\ the launchpad is set to LAUNCHPAD_ALTITUDE. The launchpad is defined as (x, z)
\ where 0 <= x < LAUNCHPAD_SIZE and 0 <= z < LAUNCHPAD_SIZE, so that's tiles 0
\ to 7 along each axis (with the origin being at the front-left corner of the
\ launchpad).
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   R8                              The x-coordinate of the landscape coordinate
\
\   R9                              The z-coordinate of the landscape coordinate
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   R0                              The altitude (y-coordinate) of the landscape
\                                   at these coordinates, with more negative
\                                   values denoting lower altitudes, as the
\                                   y-axis points downwards

\       Name: objectTypes
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: 3D objects
\    Summary: A table that maps object types to object data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Each object in the object map has a type from 0 to 24. Types 0 to 11 are for
\ intact objects, while adding 12 to get types 12 to 23 gives the object type
\ when that object has been destroyed. Destroyed objects are shown with clouds
\ of smoke particles rising up from the detritus.
\
\ Objects 0, 12 and 24 do not appear to be used anywhere. There are two
\ additional objects - the player's ship and the rock - which are defined in
\ the objectPlayer and objectRock tables, but which do not have assigned types,
\ so they can't be placed on the object map, but instead are spawned above
\ ground level.
\
\ This table links to the data for each object. Object data is shared, so types
\ 1, 3 and 4 are all identical small leafy trees, for example. However, when
\ destroyed, the smoking remains of type 1 bend to the right (type 13), while
\ the smoking remains of types 3 and 4 bend to the left (types 15 and 16).

\       Name: CalculateRotationMatrix
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Maths (Geometry)
\    Summary: Calculate the rotation matrix
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The rotation matrix is of the form:
\
\   [ xNoseV yNoseV zNoseV ]
\   [ xRoofV yRoofV zRoofV ]
\   [ xSideV ySideV zSideV ]
\
\ where the nose, roof and side vectors are the orientation vectors.
\
\ This routine sets the rotation matrix to the following:
\
\   [  cos(a) * cos(b)   -sin(a) * cos(b)   sin(b) ]
\   [       sin(a)             cos(a)          0   ]
\   [ -cos(a) * sin(b)    sin(a) * sin(b)   cos(b) ]
\
\ This matrix represents a combination of two rotations, one with angle a and
\ the other with angle b.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   R0                              The first rotation angle, a
\
\   R1                              The second rotation angle, b

\    Summary: Add a vector to the rotated vertex coordinates to get the vertex
\             coordinate in 3D space
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following:
\
\   [ xCoord ]   [ R0   ] + [ xVertexRotated ]
\   [ yCoord ] = [ R0+4 ] + [ yVertexRotated ]
\   [ zCoord ]   [ R0+8 ] + [ zVertexRotated ]
\
\ This routine is only ever called with R0 = xObject, so this adds the rotated
\ vertex coordinate to the object's coordinate, giving the vertex's coordinate
\ in the game's coordinate system.

\
\ Arguments:
\

\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Maths (Arithmetic)
\    Summary: Generate pseudo-random numbers from the random number seeds
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This algorithm appears in the original 1986 ARM Assembler manual that came
\ with Acorn's ARM Evaluation System (it's in section 11.2 on page 96). It also
\ appears in later Acorn manuals, such as Acorn Desktop Assembler (release 2),
\ where it's on page 186.
\
\ Here's the algorithm's description from the manual:
\
\ "It is often necessary to generate (pseudo-)random numbers and the most
\ efficient algorithms are based on shift generators with exclusive-or feedback
\ rather like a cyclic redundancy check generator. Unfortunately the sequence of
\ a 32-bit generator needs more than one feedback tap to be maximal length (that
\ is 2^32-1 cycles before repetition). A 33-bit shift generator with taps at
\ bits 20 and 33 is required. The basic algorithm is newbit := bit33 eor bit20,
\ shift left the 33 bit number and put in newbit at the bottom. Then do this for
\ all the newbits needed, that is 32 of them. Luckily this can all be done in
\ five S cycles."

\    Summary: Draw a large coloured particle into a slightly nearer graphics,
\             buffer according to its distance
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This command draws a large coloured particle into a graphics buffer, with the
\ buffer being chosen according to the distance of the particle in the z-axis,
\ plus one (so this routine draws the particle into a slightly nearer graphics
\ buffer than DrawParticleShadowToBuffer, so shadows never overlap their
\ corresponding particles).
\
\ This command is used for drawing particles, while DrawParticleShadowToBuffer
\ is used for drawing their shadows.
\
\ The command numbers for drawing large particles are 0 to 8, with higher
\ numbers giving smaller particles (so particles are smaller when they are
\ further away, as the command number is based on the z-coordinate). This is
\ followed by the pixel coordinates, composed into one 32-bit parameter word as
\ follows:
\
\          #20-31     #12-19    #8-11            #0-7

\    Summary: Draw a triangle shadow into the correct graphics buffer, according

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This command draws a triangle into a graphics buffer, with the buffer being
\ chosen according to the distance of the triangle in the z-axis.
\
\ This command is used for drawing triangle shadows, while the triangles
\ themselves are drawn by DrawTriangleToBuffer. It is always called with a
\ colour value of 0 in R8, so shadows are always black.
\
\ The command number for drawing a triangle is 18, followed by seven parameter
\ words that match the arguments for the DrawTriangle routine:
\
\   * Command number (18)
\   * Pixel coordinate of corner 1 (x1, y1)
\   * Pixel coordinate of corner 2 (x2, y2)
\   * Pixel coordinate of corner 3 (x3, y3)
\   * Colour
\

\
\ Arguments:

\
\   (R4, R5)                        Pixel coordinate of corner 4

\    Summary: Draw the contents of the specified graphics buffer
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws the contents of a specified graphics buffer. There are 12
\ buffers that are used to layer the game's graphics correctly according to an
\ object's distance. This system was described by David Braben in November 1987
\ issue of the Micro User:
\
\ "Since objects only need to be approximately in order, and it is known that
\ the values are in a certain range, a technique known as bin sorting is used.
\ This involves having a buffer for each of a range of depth values, and when
\ an object's position is calculated it is put into the relevant buffer. Finally
\ the buffers are flushed in depth order, farthest first. This requires a great
\ deal of memory, but is virtually free as far as time considerations go."
\
\ This routine implements a buffer being "flushed". i.e. drawn onto the screen.

\       Name: PlaceObjectsOnMap
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: 3D objects
\    Summary: Randomly place a number of objects on the map, avoiding the sea
\             and the launchpad
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The object map at objectMap contains one byte for each tile on the landscape.
\
\ This byte determines which object (if any) appears on that tile, where objects
\ are trees, buildings, rockets and so on.
\
\ A byte of &FF indicates that there is no object on that tile, while a value of
\ 0 to 24 indicates that the tile contains an object of that type.
\
\ There can be only one object on each tile.
\
\ The object map covers an area of 256 x 256 tiles, and each object is placed on
\ the front-left corner of the corresponding tile.
\
\ The object map shares the same coordinate system as the rest of the game, so
\ it uses a right-hand coordinate system, with the x-axis going from left to
\ right, the y-axis going down the screen, and the z-axis going into the screen.
\
\ Because the purpose of the object map is to record object positions on the
\ map, it does not include altitude data, so the y-axis is ignored (as the
\ altitude of an object on the landscape is determined by the landscape altitude
\ at that point). You can think of the object map as a paper map that is draped
\ over the landscape, and whose longitude and latitude values map to the x-axis
\ and z-axis respectively.
\
\ The origin of the object map is at the front-left corner of the launchpad, and
\ we can talk about coordinates on the map in terms of tiles as (x, z)
\ coordinates.
\
\ So a map coordinate of (7, 1) is 7 tiles to the right and 1 tile into the
\ screen, starting from the front-left corner of the launchpad; in this example,
\ that's the coordinate of the front rocket of the three alongside the launchpad
\ when we start the game.
\
\ The object at coordinate (x, z) is stored at offset &zzxx within objectMap, so
\ the rocket at (7, 1) is at objectMap + &0107.
\
\ As the object map stores object locations in terms of tile numbers, we can
\ think of the coordinates in the object map as &xx000000 and &zz000000 (as
\ coordinates for the game world are 32-bit), and that's why we only need to
\ store &xx and &zz.
\
\ So to convert from 3D space coordinates to object map coordinates, we can zero
\ the bottom three bytes of the 3D x-coordinate and z-coordinate to snap the
\ coordinates to the relevant tile corner, or if we only need to extract the
\ object map data, we can simply use the top two bytes in the form &zzxx.
