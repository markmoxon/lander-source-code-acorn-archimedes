\       Name: PIXEL
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing pixels
\    Summary: Implement the OSWORD 241 command (draw space view pixels)
\  Deep dive: Drawing colour pixels on the BBC Micro
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is run when the parasite sends an OSWORD 241 command with
\ parameters in the block at OSSC(1 0). It draws a dot (or collection of dots)
\ in the space view.
\
\ It can draw two types of dot, depending on bits 0-2 of the dot's distance:
\
\   * Draw the dot using the dot's distance to determine both the dot's colour
\     and size. This draws a one-pixel dot, two-pixel dash or four-pixel square
\     in a colour that's determined by the distance (as per the colour table in
\     PXCL). These kinds of dot are sent by the PIXEL3 routine in the parasite,
\     which is used to draw explosion particles.
\
\   * Draw the dot using the dot's distance to determine the dot's size, either
\     a two-pixel dash or four-pixel square. The dot is always drawn in white
\     (which is actually a cyan/red stripe). These kinds of dot are sent by the
\     PIXEL routine in the parasite, which is used to draw stardust particles
\     and dots on the Long-range Chart.
\
\ The parameters match those put into the PBUF/pixbl block in the parasite.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   OSSC(1 0)           A parameter block as follows:
\
\                         * Byte #0 = The size of the pixel buffer being sent
\
\                         * Byte #2 = The distance of the first dot
\
\                           * Bits 0-2 clear = Draw a two-pixel dash or
\                             four-pixel square, as determined by the distance,
\                             in white (cyan/red)
\
\                           * Any of bits 0-2 set = Draw a one-pixel dot,
\                             two-pixel dash or four-pixel square in the correct
\                             colour, as determined by the distance
\
\                         * Byte #3 = The x-coordinate of the first dot
\
\                         * Byte #4 = The y-coordinate of the first dot
\
\                         * Byte #5 = The distance of the second dot
\
\                         * Byte #6 = The x-coordinate of the second dot
\
\                         * Byte #7 = The y-coordinate of the second dot
