\   Category; Landscape
\    Summary; Draw the landscape and the contents of the graphics buffers, from
\             the back of the screen to the front
\  Deep dive; Drawing the landscape
\             Depth-sorting with the graphics buffers
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Both the landscape and objects are drawn one tile row at a time, working from
\ the back to the front. In each iteration, we process a horizontal row of tile
\ corners, working from left to right and back to front. For each corner we draw
\ a landscape tile where possible [i.e. when we have already processed the other
\ three corners in that tile, so we don't start drawing until we reach the
\ second corner on the second row].
\
\ Objects are drawn after the tiles on which they sit. This is achieved by
\ staggering the drawing of objects so they are drawn two rows later than the
\ landscape, so we draw an object two iterations after we have finished drawing
\ all four of its surrounding tiles. This ensures that the landscape always
\ appears behind the objects that sit on it.
\
\ More specifically, we do the following;
\
\   * Part 1; Start by setting up all the variables
\
\   * We now step through each row of tile corners, working through the tile
\     corners from left to right, one row at a time, keeping track of the row
\     number in tileCornerRow = 0 to 10
\
\     For each row of tile corners, we do the following;
\
\     * Part 2; Work along the current row of tile corners, from left to right,
\               one corner coordinate at a time, and draw each tile as a
\               quadrilateral once we have four valid corner coordinates from
\               the previous row and previous column
\
\     * Part 3; If tileCornerRow >= 2, also draw the contents of the graphics
\               buffer with number tileCornerRow - 2
\
\   * Part 4; Finish by drawing the objects in graphics buffer 9 and graphics
\             buffer 10
\
\ So we draw the objects in graphics buffer 0 just after we process tile corner
\ row 2, so that's just after we draw the tiles between corner rows 1 and 2.
\
\ Note that the game allocates memory to an extra graphics buffer, but only
\ buffers numbers 0 to TILE_Z are used.

\       Type; Subroutine
\   Category; Landscape
\    Summary; Calculate the altitude of the landscape for a given coordinate
\  Deep dive; Generating the landscape
\             Drawing the landscape
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine calculates the altitude of the landscape at a given coordinate.
\ The altitude is inverse, with lower values indicating higher altitudes. The
\ launchpad is at LAUNCHPAD_ALTITUDE, while the sea is at SEA_LEVEL.
\
\ The altitude at landscape coordinate [x, z] is calculated as follows;
\
\   LAND_MID_HEIGHT - [   2*sin[x - 2z]  + 2*sin[4x + 3z]  + 2*sin[3z - 5x]
\                       + 2*sin[3x + 3z] +   sin[5x + 11z] +   sin[10x + 7z]
\                     ] / 256
\
\ Note that the object map is flat, like a paper map, so the x- and z-axes on
\ the map correspond to the x- and z-axes in the three-dimensional space when
\ the map is laid out on the landscape [as the 3D z-axis goes into the screen].
\ When talking about the map, we are talking about [x, z] coordinates that are
\ a bit like longitude and latitude, and this routine returns the y-coordinate
\ of the point on the landscape [as the y-axis goes down the screen and
\ determines the altitude].
\
\ Note that more negative values denote lower altitudes, as the y-axis goes down
\ the screen, working down from zero at the very highest altitude in space. This
\ is the opposite to conventional altitudes in the real world.
\
\ The altitude is capped to a maximum value of SEA_LEVEL, and the altitude on
\ the launchpad is set to LAUNCHPAD_ALTITUDE. The launchpad is defined as [x, z]
\ where 0 <= x < LAUNCHPAD_SIZE and 0 <= z < LAUNCHPAD_SIZE, so that's tiles 0
\ to 7 along each axis [with the origin being at the front-left corner of the
\ launchpad].
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments;
\
\   R8                              The x-coordinate of the landscape coordinate
\
\   R9                              The z-coordinate of the landscape coordinate
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns;
\
\   R0                              The altitude [y-coordinate] of the landscape
\                                   at these coordinates, with more negative
\                                   values denoting lower altitudes, as the
\                                   y-axis points downwards

\
\ If the object currently being processed is static [i.e. bit 0 of objectFlags
\ is clear], then this routine simply returns the vector in R0 unchanged.
\
\ If the object is a rotating object, then this routine multiplies the vector at
\ R0 by the rotation matrix at rotationMatrix and store the result at the

\    Summary; Calculate the rotation matrix
\  Deep dive; Flying by mouse
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The rotation matrix is of the form;
\
\   [ xNoseV xRoofV xSideV ]
\   [ yNoseV yRoofV ySideV ]
\   [ zNoseV zRoofV zSideV ]
\
\ where the nose, roof and side vectors are the orientation vectors.
\
\ This routine sets the rotation matrix to the following;
\
\   [  cos[a] * cos[b]   -sin[a] * cos[b]   sin[b] ]
\   [       sin[a]             cos[a]          0   ]
\   [ -cos[a] * sin[b]    sin[a] * sin[b]   cos[b] ]
\
\ This matrix represents a combination of two rotations, one with angle a and
\ the other with angle b.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine projects a 3D coordinate [x, y, z] into screen coordinates, as
\ follows;
\
\   screen x-coordinate = 160 + x / z
\
\   screen y-coordinate = 64 + y / z
\
\ The screen coordinate is deemed on-screen when it is within the following
\ valid ranges;
\
\   screen x is in the range 0 to 319
\
\   screen y is in the range 0 to 238
\
\ and is at less than a 45-degree viewing angle [i.e. within a viewing cone of
\ 45 degrees].
\
\ The particle is deemed visible if its z-coordinate is less than &80000000, and
\ is not projected if it is further away than this.
\
\ The y-coordinate is the screen height [256 pixels] minus the two text lines
\ that are reserved for the score bar at the top of the screen [16 pixels].

\  Deep dive; Drawing 3D objects
\             Drawing the landscape
\             Projecting onto the screen
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine projects a 3D coordinate [x, y, z] into screen coordinates, as
\ follows;
\
\   screen x-coordinate = 160 + x / z
\
\   screen y-coordinate = 64 + y / z
\
\ The vertex is deemed visible if its z-coordinate is less than &80000000, and
\ is not projected if it is further away than this.
\
\ This routine differs from the particle projection routine in that it projects
\ vertices irrespective of their viewing angle.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments;
\
\   [R0, R1, R2]                    Particle coordinates in [x, y, z]
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns;
\
\   [R0, R1]                        Projected screen coordinates [x, y]
\
\   C flag                          C flag is set if the vertex is too far away
\                                   to draw, clear if it is close enough

\ This algorithm appears in the original 1986 ARM Assembler manual that came
\ with Acorn's ARM Evaluation System [it's in section 11.2 on page 96]. It also
\ appears in later Acorn manuals, such as Acorn Desktop Assembler [release 2],
\ where it's on page 186.
\
\ Here's the algorithm's description from the manual;
\
\ 'It is often necessary to generate [pseudo-]random numbers and the most
\ efficient algorithms are based on shift generators with exclusive-or feedback
\ rather like a cyclic redundancy check generator. Unfortunately the sequence of
\ a 32-bit generator needs more than one feedback tap to be maximal length [that
\ is 2^32-1 cycles before repetition]. A 33-bit shift generator with taps at
\ bits 20 and 33 is required. The basic algorithm is newbit ;= bit33 eor bit20,
\ shift left the 33 bit number and put in newbit at the bottom. Then do this for
\ all the newbits needed, that is 32 of them. Luckily this can all be done in
\ five S cycles.'

\
\ This command draws a small black particle into a graphics buffer, with the

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This command draws a triangle into a graphics buffer, with the buffer being
\ chosen according to the distance of the triangle in the z-axis, plus one [so
\ this routine draws the triangle into a slightly nearer graphics buffer than
\ DrawTriangleShadowToBuffer, so shadows never overlap their corresponding
\ triangles].
\
\ This command is used for drawing triangles, while DrawTriangleShadowToBuffer
\ is used to draw their shadows.
\
\ The command number for drawing a triangle is 18, followed by seven parameter
\ words that match the arguments for the DrawTriangle routine;
\
\   * Command number [18]
\
\   * Pixel coordinate of corner 1 [x1, y1]
\
\   * Pixel coordinate of corner 2 [x2, y2]
\
\   * Pixel coordinate of corner 3 [x3, y3]
\
\   * Colour

\
\ Arguments;
